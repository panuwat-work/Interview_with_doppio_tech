# For interview with Doppio Tech Co., Ltd. (21/02/2024)

### This repository is divided into three main parts of test automation tech stack:

   1. Demo Appium
   2. Demo Locust
   3. Demo Selenium (python)

---

## 1. Demo Appium 
This project utilizes Appium and Selenium to automate interactions with the Android Dialer application. It establishes a connection with a virtual device, inputs a 10-digit phone number, and initiates a call. Additionally, it integrates Line Notify to send notifications about the call status. This demonstration showcases automation capabilities for mobile application testing and interaction.

### Installation

Use [pip](https://pypi.org/project/Appium-Python-Client/) to install Appium-Python-Client selenium requests
```Zsh
pip install Appium-Python-Client selenium requests
```

---

## 2. Demo Locust 
This project utilizes Locust, a load testing tool, to simulate user behavior on the PetStore Swagger API. It defines a Locust user class MyUser1, which sends HTTP requests to various endpoints of the API. The endpoints include findPetsByStatus, placeOrder, getInventory, and createUsersWithArrayInput. The between method sets a wait time between 1 and 2 seconds for each user task. This demonstration showcases load testing capabilities for API endpoints using Locust.

### Installation

Use [pip](https://pypi.org/project/locust/) to install locust
```Zsh
pip install locust
```

---

## 3. Demo Selenium(python) 
This Python script demonstrates various commonly used functionalities for automate tester using Selenium WebDriver:

  1. Checkboxes: It selects checkboxes on a web page based on user input.
  2. Dropdowns: It interacts with dropdown menus on a web page based on user input.
  3. Login Page: It simulates logging in to a web page using provided credentials.
  4. Windows: It interacts with browser windows, opening a new window and then switching back to the original one.
  5. Notification Text: It retrieves notification text displayed on a web page.
Each function in the script represents one of these functionalities. By calling the respective function, you can demonstrate each feature individually. The script utilizes Selenium WebDriver to interact with web elements and perform actions such as clicking, inputting text, and retrieving information.

To use this script for demonstration, uncomment the desired function calls at the end of the script and execute it. Each function will showcase a different aspect of web automation using Selenium.

### Installation

Use [pip](https://pypi.org/project/selenium/) to install selenium
```Zsh
pip install selenium
```
